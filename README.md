# MugenKey-Chrome-Extension

🚀 Mugen Key is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension that enhances web accessibility by allowing users to navigate through interactive elements using keyboard shortcuts. It highlights the selected element with a circular glow effect, making it easier to track focus across the webpage. Use this if you also are tired and annoyed by repeatedly prompted to use your mouse on certain websites. 

✨ Features
✔️ Toggle Activation – Easily enable or disable the extension with a single button inside the popup menu.
✔️ Customizable Colors & Thickness – Adjust the highlight color and thickness for better visibility.
✔️ Keyboard Navigation – Use Ctrl + Arrow Keys to jump to the nearest element in any direction.
✔️ Auto Focus Tracking – The highlight moves automatically when navigating via the Tab key.
